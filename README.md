# ToDo (toh-doo) â€“ a ode to todes!

Conceptual language of any animal - todes, humans, other... that wants to use it.

## Notes

Unlike [the original TodeTode](https://github.com/TodePond/TodeTode) (which Magnogen and I call "Todelang"),
this version was designed to be slightly more human-readable,
with the lore being that a machine crashed down from the sky and the Todes there have been trying to communicate with it ever since.
