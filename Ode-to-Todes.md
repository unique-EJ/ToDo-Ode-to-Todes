# Symbols

**`>>`** means "phrase on left 👈 then does action(s) on right 👉 to an object phrase"

**`::`** means "phrase on left 👈 goes together (united) with the 🟰 object phrase 👉"

**`N`** means known objects, that the language user knows. 💭

**`O`** means "oh-no?!", other objects that users don't know. ⚠️

**`#`** means anything stops 🛑 the user or object, negating action.

and I, Edward, don't like the word "need"! No need to want something very much, to put pressure on other people for that.

> Unlike the regular [Todelang](https://github.com/TodePond/TodeTode), MountainTode consists of 9 basic symbols, which are organised in prefixes and suffixes, rather than a more general position, such as surrounding or below.

These are the MountainTode symbols, and their meanings, that people can type into a computer  
 \- and, with the help of a font, make it look like a real natural language.
