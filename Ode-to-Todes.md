# Symbols

**`/>`** means "phrase on left 👈 then does action(s) to (uses) to an object phrase on right 👉"

`oo /> ^ kn` !

**`&`** means "phrase on left 👈 goes together (united, `Y`) with 🟰 the object phrase 👉"

`kn & Y`

**`kn`** means known objects, that the language user knows. 💭

`kn /> ~ \ U`

**`oo`** means "oh-no?!", other objects that users don't know. ⚠️

`oo >`

**`#`** means anything stops 🛑 the user or object, negating action.

`Y # T >`

(and I, Edward, don't like the word "need"! No need to want something very much, to put pressure on others for that.)

> Unlike the regular [Todelang](https://github.com/TodePond/TodeTode), MountainTode consists of 9 basic symbols, which are organised in prefixes and suffixes, rather than a more general position, such as surrounding or below.

These are the MountainTode symbols, and their meanings, that people can type into a computer  
 \- and, with the help of a font, make it look like a real natural language.
