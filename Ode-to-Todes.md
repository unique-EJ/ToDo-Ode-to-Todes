# Symbols



---

> Unlike the regular [Todelang](https://github.com/TodePond/TodeTode), MountainTode consists of 9 basic symbols, which are organised in prefixes and suffixes, rather than a more general position, such as surrounding or below.

These are the MountainTode symbols, and their meanings, that people can type into a computer  
 \- and, with the help of a font, make it look like a real natural language.
